Welcome to my homepage!

My name is Jiaxin Ye. I'm a first-year PhD student in Statistics at UW Madison. Before UW Madison, I graduated Magna Cum Laude from UC San Diego with double majors in Applied Math and Computer Science in 2024.

I had the privilege of working with Professor Yuhua Zhu on a temporal difference learning project and Professor Zhuoran Yang on an in-context learning project. The latter was accepted at the NeurIPS 2023 Workshop on Foundation Models for Decision Making and later presented as a talk in Professor Bo Li's ML seminar.
